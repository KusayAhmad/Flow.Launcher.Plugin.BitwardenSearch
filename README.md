<h1>Flow Launcher - Bitwarden Vault Plugin</h1>

#########################################################
<h2>NOTICE ON DEVELOPMENT DELAYS</h2>
I greatly appreciate growing interest in the plugin and I appreciate all the helpful responses and requests people have provided. I assure you that I'm reading all of them :) <br><br>

Unfortunately, I've had a lot of life changes happen recently and I'm sort of getting caught up on all that before continuing development on the plugin. Last time I tried working on the plugin to add features and fix some minor issues, it came to my attention that the CLI version at the time was getting heavily caught by various operating system scans and systems as malware and it seriously impeded my development efforts. 

Since then, I believe those issues have been resolved, but then I had to deal with flooding, and moving, and a ton of other things that restricted my access to my primary development machine. Since then, I've been trying to sort all that out and get my development environment back in check.

With all that said, I promise the plugin is not dead - I've been feeling the pain of not being able to use my own plugin since I had to do a device reset on my development machine and haven't had time to set it all back up and I really want it to start working again and use other functions of Flow Launcher as well. I appreciate everyone's patience as I get it all sorted, just know that any difficulty in using the plugin with recent versions of the CLI will be unable to be supported by me at this time, at least until I can get the most recent version of the CLI installed and I can address any of the issues that come with that. 

I've also got to set up a version of Vaultwarden again since I've been getting more requests on that, and since I became annoyed with something regarding my hosting of it and just switched to Bitwarden's hosted instance and I pay for it, I sort of dropped it off my radar.

Thank you again for your patience and for the folks who have been sleuthing the issues section to help members having issues that they can help with. I cannot overstate how thankful I am to y'all for your support with that effort :)

This is a Flow Launcher plugin for Bitwarden - an application I like to use for password management. I noticed there wasn't a plugin to provide this functionality, so I thought I'd make one myself.<br><br>
This is my first ever Flow Launcher plugin, so I am open to suggestions/critique on ways I can improve this.

<h2>Features</h2>
As of this release (<b>1.3.2</b>), it contains the following capabilities:<br><br>

1) Fuzzy search across your vault via the bw command with icon population of individual vault items based on the URIs you have saved in your individual vault items.
2) Icon caching for faster population of visuals.
3) The ability to copy usernames, passwords, TOTPs, and URI's for each vault item with an expander for URI items in case you have multiple listed that you can select from.
4) An adjustable log that defaults to showing only Warning and Error messages, but can be expanded to show additional logging from the Flow Launcher settings menu.
5) Adjustable notification settings for copy settings, auto-lock, and sync operations.
6) Adjustable vault auto-lock timeouts ranging from letting you keep your vault unlocked, or setting it to lock automatically after however many minutes.
7) Adjustable clipboard clearing settings that mirror the official Bitwarden client. Defaults to 'None'.
8) Manual sync - updated a URI for a vault item you don't have an icon for and want to refresh it? Added a new account and want to immediately see it in your search from Flow Launcher? Manually run the <code>/sync</code> command to immediately sync your vault and icons.
    - This also occurs after each unlock asynchronously with the unlock process so there shouldn't be any delay beyond the initial unlock.
9) CLI setting assist now exists in the plugin settings. Just download the CLI into a location of your choosing and use the file picker in the plugin settings to point to it and set your user PATH variable to include this PATH automatically. No more hunting around in Windows settings yourself to set this stuff.
    - Even if you've already done this process in previous versions, it is advised to still point to your bw.exe file in the plugin settings. It will automatically detect if you've already added it to your PATH variable in either SYSTEM or USER settings.
    - **NEW** - Can now download the CLI directly from the settings screen, which will automatically extract to a location of your choice, and add the PATH variables accordingly if they're not already there.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
In order to use this plugin, you have to have the <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/#download-and-install">Bitwarden CLI downloaded</a>.<br>
<li>You <b>MUST</b> use any version between 2024.7.2 and 2024.8.2 - the API login process is broken on older versions and 2024.9.0 has binary issues that interfere with the unlock process using the plugin.</li>
<li><b>NEW</b> - You can now use the settings menu for the plugin to help set your environment variables if you navigate to your bw.exe file on your computer using the included file picker.</li>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
Install from the Plugin Store from the Flow Launcher settings menu or type the following in Flow Launcher ðŸ˜Š:<br><br>

<code>pm install bitwarden</code>

<h2>Regarding Self-Hosted Instances</h2> 
If you use a self-hosted instance of Bitwarden/Vaultwarden, it has been reported to me that it will work (which I would generally expect since the API endpoints are not different), but you need to set your server settings in the CLI manually for now before attempting to login using the plugin.<br><br> 
I intend on adding server options to the plugin settings in a future update, but for now this step will have to be performed first if you want it to connect to your self-hosted instance. I don't have a self-hosted instance to test things these days so my ability to support these scenarios are limited.

<h2>How to Use:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upon installation of the plugin, you'll need to configure the plugin settings and provide the following attributes:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Bitwarden CLI executable location. 
    <ul>
      <li>You should keep this file named bw.exe so command references work correctly.</li>
      <li>Make sure to click the text to add the path to your user <code>PATH</code> environment variable if it isn't already there.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Your Bitwarden <code>client_id</code> from your respective Bitwarden API menu</li>
    <li>Your Bitwarden <code>client_secret</code> from your respective BitwardenAPI menu</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Instructions for the API stuff can be found in the plugin settings menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Adjust your desired settings for logging, notifications, vault unlock timeout, and automatic clipboard clearing settings.
    <li><s>You will need to restart Flow Launcher in order for the credentials in the plugin settings to take effect. This is not required when changing any other setting in the plugin.</s>
    <ul>
      <li>This is no longer required! It should immediately start working after you've provided your API credentials.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Type <code>bw</code> before your search-term to start populating items in your vault.
  <ul>
    <li>If your vault is locked, you will be prompted to unlock it first with the <code>/unlock</code> sub-command to continue.
    <li>You will be notified when your vault is unlocked and ready to be used with a OS notification.
    <ul>
      <li>If you have sync status notifications enabled, as soon as you see the notification that your vault is syncing, it is ready to use.
      <li>Otherwise, if you have those notifications turned off, you'll just get the standard 'vault is unlocked' notification and you'll know it's ready.
    </ul>
  <li>Adding sub-command <code>/lock</code> or <code>/unlock</code> after <code>bw</code> (make sure to include a space between them) will allow you to manually lock and unlock the vault respectively.
  <li>Adding sub-command <code>/sync</code> will sync your vault items and their respective icons. 
  <li>Just pressing <code>ENTER</code> on the populated item will copy the password.</li>
  <li>Pressing <code>CTRL</code>+<code>ENTER</code> copies the username.</li>
  <li>Pressing <code>CTRL</code>+<code>SHIFT</code>+<code>ENTER</code> brings up the URI menu where you can use the <code>UP</code> and <code>DOWN</code> arrow keys to select your preferred URI and press <code>ENTER</code> to copy it to your clipboard.</li>
  <li>Pressing <code>CTRL</code>+<code>T</code>+<code>ENTER</code> copies the TOTP.
</ul>
