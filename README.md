<h1>Flow Launcher - Bitwarden Vault Plugin</h1>

This is a Flow Launcher plugin for Bitwarden - an application I like to use for password management. I noticed there wasn't a plugin to provide this functionality, so I thought I'd make one myself.<br><br>
This is my first ever Flow Launcher plugin, so I am open to suggestions/critique on ways I can improve this.

<h2>Features</h2>
As of this release, it contains the following capabilities:<br><br>

1) Fuzzy search across your vault via the bw command with icon population of individual vault items based on the URIs you have saved in your individual vault items.
2) Icon caching for faster population of visuals.
3) The ability to copy usernames, passwords, TOTPs, and URI's for each vault item with an expander for URI items in case you have multiple listed that you can select from.
4) An adjustable log that defaults to showing only Warning and Error messages, but can be expanded to show additional logging from the Flow Launcher settings menu.
5) Adjustable notification settings for copy settings.
6) Adjustable vault auto-lock timeouts ranging from letting you keep your vault unlocked, or setting it to lock automatically after however many minutes.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
In order to use this plugin, you must have the <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/#download-and-install">Bitwarden CLI installed</a>.

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
Install from the Plugin Store from the Flow Launcher settings menu or type the following in Flow Launcher ðŸ˜Š:<br><br>

<h2>How to Use:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upon installation of the plugin, you'll need to configure the plugin settings and provide the following attributes:</li>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Type <code>bw</code> before your search-term to start populating items in your vault.
  <li>Adding sub-command <code>/lock</code> or <code>/unlock</code> after <code>bw</code> (make sure to include a space between them) will allow you to manually lock and unlock the vault respectively. 
  <li>Just pressing <code>ENTER</code> on the populated item will copy the password.</li>
  <li>Pressing <code>CTRL</code>+<code>ENTER</code> copies the username.</li>
  <li>Pressing <code>CTRL</code>+<code>SHIFT</code>+<code>ENTER</code> brings up the URI menu where you can use the <code>UP</code> and <code>DOWN</code> arrow keys to select your preferred URI and press <code>ENTER</code> to copy it to your clipboard.</li>
